## 🚀 How to Run Evaluations

### Quick Test (5 queries, ~5 minutes)

```bash
# Test RAG mode only
python3 eval/benchmark.py --mode rag --num-queries 5

# Test both modes and compare
python3 eval/benchmark.py --mode both --num-queries 5

# Skip LLM judge (faster)
python3 eval/benchmark.py --mode both --num-queries 5 --no-judge
```

---

### Full Evaluation (25 queries, ~30 minutes)

```bash
# Run complete evaluation with LLM-as-judge
python3 eval/benchmark.py --mode both --num-queries 25
```

**What it does**:
1. Runs 25 queries through **non-RAG mode** (Phase 1 baseline)
2. Runs same 25 queries through **RAG mode** (Phase 2)
3. Uses GPT-4 as judge to score quality
4. Generates comparison report
5. Saves results to `eval/results_*.json`

---

### Command-Line Options

```bash
python3 eval/benchmark.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --mode {rag,no_rag,both}    Which mode to test (default: both)
  --num-queries N             Number of queries (default: 5)
  --no-judge                  Skip LLM-as-judge evaluation
  -h, --help                  Show help message
```

## 🎯 Next Steps After Evaluation

### Immediate (After First Run)
1. ✅ Review results in terminal output
2. ✅ Check JSON files for detailed metrics
3. ✅ Verify RAG improvements are statistically significant

### Week 2 Remaining Tasks
1. ⏳ Export LangSmith data (scripts/export_langsmith_data.py)
2. ⏳ Train ML routing classifier (src/ml/routing_classifier.py)
3. ⏳ Build A/B testing framework (src/ab_testing.py)
4. ⏳ Generate final evaluation report

---

## 🧪 Testing Tips

### For Quick Iteration
```bash
# Test with just 3 queries, no judge (fastest)
python3 eval/benchmark.py --mode rag --num-queries 3 --no-judge
```

### For Accurate Results
```bash
# Use all 25 queries with LLM judge
python3 eval/benchmark.py --mode both --num-queries 25
```

### For Debugging
```python
# Run in Python REPL for debugging
python3
>>> from eval.benchmark import BenchmarkRunner
>>> runner = BenchmarkRunner(enable_rag=True)
>>> queries = runner.load_test_queries()
>>> result = runner.run_single_query(queries[0])
>>> print(result)
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Module not found: eval.benchmark"
```bash
# Run from project root
cd /workspaces/multi_agent_workflow
python3 eval/benchmark.py
```

### "LangSmith tracing error"
- This is normal, just a warning
- Doesn't affect benchmark functionality

### "Semantic Scholar 429 error"
- Expected due to rate limiting
- System falls back to arXiv automatically
- Results are still valid

### Slow execution
- Each query takes 30-60s with RAG
- 5 queries = ~5 minutes total
- Use `--no-judge` to skip quality scoring (saves ~1-2 min per query)

---

## 📝 Notes

- **LLM judge uses GPT-5** - For consistency with system
- **Caching enabled** - 7-day TTL on research results
- **No memory** - Each query independent for fair testing
- **Semantic Scholar rate limits** - Expected, system handles gracefully

---

**Ready to start!** Run your first evaluation:

```bash
python3 eval/benchmark.py --mode both --num-queries 5
```

This will give you baseline data and show if RAG is improving quality! 🚀

Done.
