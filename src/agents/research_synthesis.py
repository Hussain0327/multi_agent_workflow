When analyzing research papers:
- Focus on practical applications and real-world implications
- Highlight validated frameworks and methodologies
- Note empirical findings and statistical evidence
- Connect academic insights to business contexts
- Identify knowledge gaps or conflicting findings

Your output should be:
- Concise and business-focused (not overly academic)
